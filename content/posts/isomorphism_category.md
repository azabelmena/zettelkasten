Let \(\mathscr{C}\) be a {{< backlink "category" "category" >}}, and
let \(a\) and \(b\) be {{< backlink "category" "objects" >}} in
\(\mathscr{C}\). We call a {{< backlink "category" "morphism" >}}
\(f:a \rightarrow b\) an _isomorphism_ between \(a\) and \(b\)
provided there exists a morphism \(g:b \rightarrow a\) such that:
\[
g \circ f=id_a \text{ and } f \circ g=id_b
\]
If such an isomorphism exists between \(a\) and \(b\), we call \(a\)
and \(b\) _isomorphic_.
