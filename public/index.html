  <meta name="description" content="Welcome to my wonderful Zettelkasten of mathematics definitions! I’m quite new to this, and still getting the hang of things. However, this will be where I store mathematics definitions that I personally need quick access to. Of course, this is all in the public domain, and anyone is free to access it; just keep in mind it is not necessarily what you need.
These zettelkastens (which I have named definitions) will be continuously updated on (what I hope is) a regular basis. Additionally, there are several organizational things I need to get out the way, so keep in mind that the structure of this zettelkasten will look different. If you want to know more about my personal process, feel free to read the zibaldones I label as zettelkasten here. Occasionally, I will add some remarks to the definitions about certain (well known) results, however this is a zettelkasten for definitions first, and foremost, not results. It is even less so a zettelkasten for proofs. If you want more in-depths notes containing actual results and the accompanying proof, you will need to look at my notes page which contains actual information on how to access and compile my notes (for which I DO NOT claim to be my own intellectual property)." />

      <p>Welcome to my wonderful <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#luhmanns-zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a>
of mathematics definitions! I&rsquo;m quite new to this, and still getting the hang
of things. However, this will be where I store mathematics definitions that I
personally need quick access to. Of course, this is all in the public domain,
and anyone is free to access it; just keep in mind it is not necessarily what you
<em>need</em>.</p>
<p>These zettelkastens (which I have named definitions) will be
continuously updated on (what I hope is) a regular basis.
Additionally, there are several organizational things I need to get
out the way, so keep in mind that the structure of this zettelkasten
<em>will</em> look different. If you want to know more about my personal
process, feel free to read the zibaldones I label as <em>zettelkasten</em>
<a href="https://azabelmena.github.io/zibaldone/">here</a>. Occasionally, I will
add some remarks to the definitions about certain (well known)
results, however this is a zettelkasten for definitions first, and
foremost, not results. It is even less so a zettelkasten for proofs.
If you want more in-depths <em>notes</em> containing actual results and the
accompanying proof, you will need to look at my
<a href="https://azabelmena.github.io/notes/">notes page</a> which contains
actual information on how to access and compile my notes (for which I <em>DO
NOT</em> claim to be my own intellectual property).</p>
