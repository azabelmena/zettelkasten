Welcome to my wonderful [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#luhmanns-zettelkasten)
of mathematics definitions! Here you can find a curated list of
mathematics definitions from various different disciplines in
mathematics. The aim is to provide (among many other sites) a
centralized repository where I can find definitions with
relative ease. I say _I_ and not _we_ because first and foremost, this
zettelkasten is for my own personal use for when I need quick access
to definitions. You'll find most of the definitions
here line up with _my_ personal research interests and work. However,
this work is all in the public domain, and _anyone_ is free to access
it; just keep in mind it is not necessarily what you _need_.

There are some things that need to be moved out the way first:

{{< admonition type="tip" title="Definitions only please!">}}
This zettelkasten is _exclusively_ for mathematical definitions,
and mathematical definitions only. I will occaisonally leave remarks
assuming, or hinting at well known results, but no explicit results or
theorems will be mentioned, their proofs, even less. If you want more
in-depths results to go along, you have to look else-where. You may
look at my [notes page](https://azabelmena.github.io/notes/), compile
my \(\LaTeX\) notes (for which _I DO NOT_ claim as my own intellectual
property), and go from there.

{{< admonition type="tip" title="Zettelkastens and Zibaldones">}}
I do have somewhat of a personal process regarding these. I have also
started keeping a [zibaldone](https://www.ivanseymus.com/on-keeping-a-zibaldone-commonplace-book/)
for which I (at-least I hope I will) jot down some observations and
reflections. No doubt, I will be reflecting on also keeping an
online zettelkasten  If you want to know more about my personal
process, feel free to read the zibaldones I label as _zettelkasten_
[here](https://zibaldone.azabelmena.xyz).

I hope to update these zettelkastens on a regular basis, in accordance
to my immediate needs given my research work and interests, and given
my self study habits. In fact, the zettelkasten has provided me
another paradigm of self study all in itself.

These zettelkastens lack a structure and are rather free form as of
now. I haven't decided whether I will group these zettelkastens under
different topics to which each definition pertains. However, I believe
so far that the free form nature of the project is actually a benefit,
and there is no need to impose structure where it is not necessary.
For the most part, the [graph](https://zettelkasten.azabelmena.xyz/graph)
imparts and implies most, if not _all_ the structure of the
zettelkasten. I encourage you to just pick a definition and get lost
in the web of vertices!
