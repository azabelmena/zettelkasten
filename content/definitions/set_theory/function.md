A _function_ is a [triple]() \((X,Y,f)\) such that \(f
\subseteq X \times Y\) and whenever \((x,y) \in f\) and \((x,y') \in f\),
then we have \(y=y'\). We denote the triple \((X,Y,f)\) simply by \(f\),
or by the notation: \(f:X \rightarrow Y\). We call \(X\) the _domain_ of \(f\)
and we call \(Y\) the _codomain_ of \(f\). Given \((c,d) \in f\) we,
write f(c)=d
