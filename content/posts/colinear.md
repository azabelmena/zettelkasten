Let \(G\) be an {{< backlink "incidence_geometry" "incidence geometry" >}}.
We call two points \( A,B \in G \) _colinear_ if there exists a line
\( l \) containing both \(A\) and \(B\). We call \(A\) and \(B\)
_non-colinear_ otherwise.

{{<sidenote "remark">}}
By definition of \(G\), any two points are colinear by axiom (1), so
that non-colinear points must occur in triples. Indeed axiom (3)
for incidence geometry ensures the existence of non-colinear points.
