Let \(A\) and \(B\) be {{< backlink "set" "sets" >}}. We say that
\(A\) is a _subset_ of \(B\) provided every element of \(A\) is also a
element of \(A\): that is \(A\) is a subset of \(B\) if, and only if
for every \(a \in A\), we also have \(a \in B\). We write \(A \subseteq B\) to
denote that \(A\) is a subset of \(B\).
