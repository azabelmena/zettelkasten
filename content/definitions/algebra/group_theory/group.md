A **group** is a set \(G\) together with a binary operation \(\ast: G
\times G \rightarrow G\) such that the following properties are satisfied:

(Closure). For every \(a, b \in  G\), we have \( a \ast b \in G\)

(Associativity). The operation \(\ast: G \times G \rightarrow G\) is
[associative](algebra/group_theory/associative)

(Identity). \(G\) has an [identity element](algebra/group_theory/identity_element).

(Inverse). Every element \(a \in G\) has an [inverse
element](algebra/group_theory/inverse_element).
