A {{< backlink "ring" "ring" >}} \(R\) is said
to have _identity_ if \(R\) has an
{{< backlink "identity_element" "identity element">}} under the
{{< backlink "binary_operation" "binary operation" >}} \( \cdot: R
\times R \rightarrow R \). We denote the identity element of \(R\)
under \( \cdot: R \times R \rightarrow R \) by \(1\).
