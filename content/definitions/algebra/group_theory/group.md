A **group** is a set \(G\) together with a [binary
operation](/definitions/algebra/group_theory/binary_operation)
\(\ast: G \times G \rightarrow G\) such that the following properties
are satisfied:

(Closure). For every \(a, b \in  G\), we have \( a \ast b \in G\)

(Associativity). The operation \(\ast: G \times G \rightarrow G\) is
[associative](/definitions/algebra/group_theory/associative)

(Identity). \(G\) has an [identity element](/definitions/algebra/group_theory/identity_element).

(Inverse). Every element \(a \in G\) has an [inverse
element](/definitions/algebra/group_theory/inverse_element).
