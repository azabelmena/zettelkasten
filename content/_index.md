Welcome to my wonderful [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#luhmanns-zettelkasten)
of mathematics definitions! I'm quite new to this, and still getting the hang
of things. However, this will be where I store mathematics definitions that I
personally need quick access to. Of course, this is all in the public domain,
and anyone is free to access it; just keep in mind it is not necessarily what you
_need_.

These zettelkastens (which I have named definitions) will be
continuously updated on (what I hope is) a regular basis.
Additionally, there are several organizational things I need to get
out the way, so keep in mind that the structure of this zettelkasten
_will_ look different. If you want to know more about my personal
process, feel free to read the zibaldones I label as _zettelkasten_
[here](https://azabelmena.github.io/zibaldone/). Occasionally, I will
add some remarks to the definitions about certain (well known)
results, however this is a zettelkasten for definitions first, and
foremost, not results. It is even less so a zettelkasten for proofs.
If you want more in-depths _notes_ containing actual results and the
accompanying proof, you will need to look at my
[notes page](https://azabelmena.github.io/notes/) which contains
actual information on how to access and compile my notes (for which I _DO
NOT_ claim to be my own intellectual property).
