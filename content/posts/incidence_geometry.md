An _incidence geometry_ is a {{< backlink "set" "set" >}}, whose
elements are called _points_, together with a collection of
{{< backlink "subset" "subsets" >}}, whose elements are called
_lines_, such that the following hold:

(1.) For any two distince points \(A\) an \(B\) there is a unique
line \(l\) for which \(A,B \in l\).

(2.) Every line contains at-least two points.

(3.) For any three points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), there exists a
line \(l\) for which \(A,B \in l\) but \(C \notin l\).
