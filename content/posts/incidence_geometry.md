An _incidence geometry_ is a {{< backlink "set" "set" >}} \(G\),
whose elements are called _points_, together with a collection of
{{< backlink "subset" "subsets" >}} \(\mathcal{L}\), whose elements
are called _lines_, such that the following hold:

(1). For any points \( A,B \in G \), there exists a unique line
\( l \in \mathcal{L} \) for which \( A,B \in l \).

(2). For every line \( l \in \mathcal{L} \), \( |l| \geq 2 \).

(3). There exists points \( A,B,C \in G \), and a line \( l \in
\mathcal{L} \) such that \( A,B \in l \) but \( C \notin l \).

If \( P \in G \) is a point, and \( l \in \mathcal{L} \) is a line,
we say that \( P \) _passes_, (, or _cuts_, or _lies on_) \(l\)
provided \( P \in l \).
