Let \(R\) be a {{< backlink "ring" "ring" >}}, and \(x\) an
indeterminate. We define a _polynomial_ in \(x\), over \(R\) to be an
expression of the form:
\[
f(x)=a_0+a+1x+\dots+a_nx^n
\]
for some [integer]() \(n \in \Z^+\), and where \(a_0, \dots, a_n \in R\).

{{< sidenote "remark" >}}
In most cases, the indeterminate \(x\) is understood and so we omit
any explicit mention to it most of the time.
