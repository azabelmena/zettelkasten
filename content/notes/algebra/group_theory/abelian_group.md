An _Abelian group_ is a [group](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/group_theory/group)
\(G\) whose [binary operation](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/binary_operation) is
[commutative](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/commutative)

We remark that Abelian groups are also sometimes called _commutative
groups_.
