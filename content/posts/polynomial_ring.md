Let \(R\) be a {{< backlink "ring" "ring" >}}, we define the
_polynomial ring_ \(R[x]\), in the indeterminate \(x\), over \(R\) to
be the ring of all polyonmials in \(x\) over \(R\); that is:
\[
R[x]=\{ f(x)=a_0+a_1x+\dots+a_nx^n :
a_0, \dots, a_n \in R \text{ and } n \in \Z^+\}
\]
made into a ring under
{{< backlink "polynomial_addition" "polynomial addition" >}} and
{{< backlink "polynomial_multiplication" "polynomial multiplication" >}}.
