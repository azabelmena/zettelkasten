A _group_ is a non-empty [set]() \(G\) together with a [binary
operation](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/binary_operation) \(\ast: G \times G
\rightarrow G\) such that the following hold:

(Closure) For every \(a,b \in G\), the product \(a \ast b \in G\).

(Associativity) The binary operation \(\ast: G \times G \rightarrow G\) is
[associative](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/associative).

(Identity) \(G\) has an [identity
element](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/identity_element).

(Inverse) There exists an [inverse
element](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/inverse_element) for every
element \(a \in G\).

We remark that the axiom of closure in this definition is redundant
by the definition of a [binary
operation](/zettelkasten/definitions/algebra/binary_operation), which
guarantees that \[\ast(G \times G) \subseteq G\].
