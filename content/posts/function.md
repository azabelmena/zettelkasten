A _function_ is a {{< backlink "ordered_triple" "triple" >}}
\((X,Y,f)\) such that \(f \subseteq X \times Y\) and whenever \((x,y) \in f\)
and \((x,y') \in f\), then we have \(y=y'\). We denote the triple \((X,Y,f)\)
simply by \(f\), or by the notation: \(f:X \rightarrow Y\). We call \(X\) the
_domain_ of \(f\) and we call \(Y\) the _codomain_ of \(f\). Given \((x,y) \in f\)
we, write \(f(x)=y\).
